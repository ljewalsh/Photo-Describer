A simple tkinter GUI to aid in the description of photographs.

Requirements: 
   - Python 2.7
   - Python Imaging Library(PIL) - download from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
   
To start: 
    - Run photo_describer.py
    - Browse to the folder of images and hit describe
    - Your descriptions, tags, address, and lat/long will be saved to a file named manifest.csv when you hit previous or next
    - Exit the window to end a session. You may continue describing the same photographs by repeating the above steps (photos already described will be skipped, though they will still be accessible to edit through the previous button).
